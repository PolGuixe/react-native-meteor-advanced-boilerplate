This boilerplate is heavily inspired in @spencercarli [boilerplate's](https://github.com/spencercarli/react-native-meteor-boilerplate) and his courses and posts.

## What do you get in this Boilerplate

### Meteor
- [x] [Airbnb ESlint configuration](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb) + meteor adaptations: [eslint-meteor-plugin](https://github.com/dferber90/eslint-plugin-meteor)  and [eslint-import-resolver-meteor](https://github.com/clayne11/eslint-import-resolver-meteor)
- [x] Meteor with accounts-password
- [ ] Meteor without blaze

### React Native
- [x] [Airbnb ESlint configuration](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb) + RN adaptations
- [x] [react-native-meteor](https://github.com/inProgress-team/react-native-meteor)
- [x] [react-native-elements](https://github.com/react-native-training/react-native-elements)
- [x] [React-navigation](https://reactnavigation.org)

### Dev Tools Included
- [x] [React Native Devtools](https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools/blob/master/packages/react-devtools/README.md)

Run `npm run devtools`, after running `react-native run-ios` or `react-native run-android`.

- [x] [React Native Debugger](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger)

After install run `npm run rndebugger-setup`. This modifies the RN packager to run the debugger each yo do `react-native run-ios` or `react-native run-android`. Great isn't it :sunglasses:
